what is MSE 

These MSE values will give you an idea of the performance of each model on the test set. Lower MSE values indicate better predictive performance. Keep in mind that MSE alone might not provide the complete picture of model performance, so it's a good practice to consider other evaluation metrics and potentially visualize the results, as you've already done with the scatter plots in your script.

MSE stands for Mean Squared Error. It's a commonly used metric to measure the average squared differences between the predicted values and the actual (true) values in a regression problem. The squared differences are calculated for each data point, then averaged to provide a single value that represents the overall quality of the model's predictions.
